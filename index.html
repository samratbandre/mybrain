            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The education system in India is undergoing a transformation with the
                implementation of various initiatives and policies. The government is focusing on improving the quality
                of education and increasing access to education for all. This includes initiatives such as the Right to
                Education Act, which guarantees free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14, and the
                National Education Policy, which aims to reform the education system and make it more inclusive and
                accessible. In addition, technology is playing a major role in the transformation of education in India,
                with the increasing use of digital tools and resources in the classroom and the development of online
                learning platforms. Overall, the education system in India is moving towards a more modern and effective
                model, with the goal of providing a high-quality education to all citizens.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">"Let's grow together and improve the education system" is a call to
                action for individuals and communities to work together towards the common goal of improving the
                education system. This could involve advocating for changes in policy, volunteering time and resources
                to support schools and students, or simply promoting the value of education within one's own community.
                By coming together and collaborating, it is possible to bring about positive change in the education
                system and create a better future for all. This mindset is especially important in the context of
                education, as it highlights the importance of collective effort and the potential for all stakeholders
                to contribute towards a common goal. By working together, it is possible to create a more inclusive,
                accessible, and effective education system for all.
